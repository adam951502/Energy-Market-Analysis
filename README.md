# **Project Title: Market Value Analysis of Wind and Solar Power**

This project uses Python to analyze the market value of wind and solar power across different electricity markets in Germany, Sweden, and France. The analysis focuses on the value factor and market value of wind and solar power over the period from 2016 to 2018.

The analysis reveals that the value factor and market value of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar tend to decrease as their share in the power market increases. This is due to the inherent variability and location dependence of these energy sources, which can negatively affect their economic value.

## **Project Structure**

- **`main.py`**: This is the main Python script that runs the analysis. It reads the input data, performs the calculations, and outputs the results.
- **`Final-report.pdf`**: This is the final report of the project, which includes detailed discussions, conclusions, and potential enhancements for the model.

## **Setup and Usage**

To run the analysis, ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the required dependencies. Run the **`main.py`** script to start the analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the path to the Excel file containing the input data. After the script finishes running, it will output the results to the console and generate a regression report as a CSV file.

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
